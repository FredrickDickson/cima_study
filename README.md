## 🔧 Admin Setup

### **Initial Admin Account Creation**

For the first-time setup, you'll need to create an admin account to access the administrative dashboard:

1. **Navigate to Admin Setup**
   ```
   http://localhost:5000/admin-setup
   ```

2. **Use Setup Key**
   ```
   Setup Key: CIMA_ADMIN_SETUP_2024
   ```

3. **Admin Account Process**
   - **Option A**: If you already have a user account via OAuth:
     - Enter your registered email address
     - Use the setup key above
     - Your account will be upgraded to admin role
   
   - **Option B**: Create admin account manually (development only):
     - Use the debug endpoint: `POST /api/admin/create-user`
     - Provide email, firstName, lastName, and setupKey
     - Admin account will be created with full privileges

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **Database Connection Issues**

- Ensure your Neon database endpoint is enabled
- Memory fallback allows continued development during database issues

#### **Authentication Problems**
- Clear browser cookies and local storage
- Verify Replit OAuth configuration
- Check that you're accessing the correct domain/port
- Ensure session store is functioning (memory or PostgreSQL)

#### **Admin Access Issues**
- Verify you're using the correct setup key: `CIMA_ADMIN_SETUP_2024`
- Ensure your user account exists before admin setup
- Check that you have the correct email address
- Try the manual admin creation endpoint for development
