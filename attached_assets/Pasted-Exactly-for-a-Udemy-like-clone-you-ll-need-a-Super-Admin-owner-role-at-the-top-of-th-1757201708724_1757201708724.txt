Exactly 👍 — for a **Udemy-like clone**, you’ll need a **Super Admin (owner)** role at the top of the hierarchy.

Here’s the breakdown of roles and their powers:

---

# 👥 Roles in Your Udemy Clone

## 1. **Super Admin (Owner)**

* **Full control of the platform**.
* Responsibilities:

  * Approve/reject instructors.
  * Approve/reject courses before they go live.
  * Manage all users (students, instructors, admins).
  * Control platform settings (branding, categories, fees, payment gateway).
  * Manage revenue split (e.g., 70% instructor / 30% platform).
  * Handle disputes & refunds.
  * Access full analytics (sales, engagement, revenue).

---

## 2. **Admin / Moderator (optional, under Super Admin)**

* Helps manage platform day-to-day.
* Responsibilities:

  * Moderate content (check for violations).
  * Handle student complaints.
  * Approve basic updates from instructors.
  * Limited access compared to Super Admin.

---

## 3. **Instructor (Course Creator)**

* Can only manage their own courses.
* Responsibilities:

  * Create, edit, and upload courses.
  * Upload course media (videos, PDFs, quizzes).
  * View student enrollments & earnings (for their own courses).
  * Withdraw funds (Paystack payout).

---

## 4. **Student (Learner)**

* Can only enroll & consume content.
* Responsibilities:

  * Browse courses, purchase/enroll.
  * Watch videos, complete quizzes.
  * Leave ratings & reviews.
  * Download resources (if allowed).
  * Track progress & get completion certificates.

---

# 🔑 Role-Based Access Example (Supabase RLS / Express Middleware)

* **Super Admin** → `can_do_everything`.
* **Admin** → CRUD on courses + users (limited).
* **Instructor** → CRUD only on own courses.
* **Student** → Read-only access to published courses + purchase.

👉 So yes, **Super Admin is essential** — without them, there’s no control over what instructors upload (imagine anyone uploading anything like pirated movies 😅).

Would you like me to **map this out as a permissions matrix** (a table of who can do what) so it’s crystal clear?
