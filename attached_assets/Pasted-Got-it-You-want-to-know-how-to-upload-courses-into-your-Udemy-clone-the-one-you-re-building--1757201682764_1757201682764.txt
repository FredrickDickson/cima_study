Got it 👍 You want to know **how to upload courses into your Udemy clone** (the one you’re building with Flutter + Supabase or React + Express). I’ll walk you through the flow step by step so you understand what’s needed both from the **backend** and the **frontend**.

---

## 1. Course Upload Flow (like Udemy)

A typical Udemy-like platform allows instructors to:

1. **Create a course** – enter title, description, category, language, price.
2. **Upload media** – course thumbnail, promo video, and lesson videos.
3. **Add course content** – sections, lectures, quizzes, assignments.
4. **Publish course** – admin approval or direct publish.

## 2. Backend Requirements

Depending on your stack:

### If using **Supabase** (Flutter clone):

* **Database tables**:

  * `courses` (id, instructor\_id, title, description, price, thumbnail\_url, status)
  * `course_sections` (id, course\_id, title, order)
  * `lectures` (id, section\_id, title, video\_url, duration, order)
  * `quizzes` (optional: id, lecture\_id, question, answers, correct\_answer)

* **Storage (Supabase buckets)**:

  * `course_thumbnails` → for images
  * `course_videos` → for lecture videos

* **RLS policies**:

  * Instructors can upload/manage only their own courses.
  * Students can only read/purchase enrolled courses.

---

### If using **Express + MongoDB**:

* API endpoints:

  * `POST /courses` → create new course
  * `POST /courses/:id/sections` → add a section
  * `POST /courses/:id/lectures` → upload lectures
  * `POST /upload` → handle video/image upload (to S3, Cloudinary, or local storage)
  * `PUT /courses/:id/publish` → publish course
* MongoDB collections:

  * `courses`, `sections`, `lectures`, `users`, `enrollments`.

---

## 3. Frontend (Flutter or React)

* **Instructor Dashboard**:

  * Form to create course (title, desc, price, category).
  * File upload for thumbnail and promo video.
  * UI to add sections and lectures (drag & drop or step-by-step).
* **Upload handling**:

  * Call backend or Supabase storage API to upload videos/images.
  * Store file URLs in database.
* **Preview & Publish**:

  * Instructor can preview the course.
  * Publish button → update course status to "published".

---

## 4. Video Upload Considerations

* **Direct upload to Supabase storage** (for Flutter version).
* **For Express version**:

  * Use AWS S3, Cloudinary, or Firebase Storage for hosting videos (safer than local).
  * Store returned file URL in database.

---

## 5. Student Side (consumption)

* Students should see:

  * Course landing page (details, price, reviews).
  * Enroll button (integrated with Paystack).
  * Course player (with video, progress tracking, notes, Q\&A).

👉 Question for you:
Do you want me to **write out the Supabase SQL + storage policies for course upload** (so you can paste them in), or do you prefer I give you a **step-by-step Flutter UI code example** for uploading a course?
